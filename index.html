    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Steven Tyler is an iconic American singer, songwriter, and performer, best known as the dynamic frontman of the
      legendary rock band Aerosmith. Born on March 26, 1948, in Yonkers, New York, Tyler’s journey into music began at
      an early age, influenced by his father, who was a classical musician. His powerful vocals, wide vocal range, and
      unmistakable scream quickly set him apart, earning him the nickname "The Demon of Screamin’" and establishing him
      as one of the most recognizable voices in rock and roll history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 1970s, Tyler co-founded Aerosmith alongside guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton. The band
      quickly rose to fame with a series of hit albums and timeless songs like "Dream On," "Sweet Emotion," and "Walk
      This Way." Their bluesy hard rock sound, combined with Tyler’s electrifying stage presence, made them one of the
      biggest rock bands in the world. Despite facing struggles with substance abuse and internal conflicts during the
      late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyler and the band made a legendary comeback, solidifying their place in music
      history.
    </p>
    <p>

      Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Aerosmith in 2001. He is celebrated not only for his vocals and songwriting but
      also for his flamboyant fashion style, often seen wearing scarves, bold patterns, and colorful outfits on stage.
      Beyond music, Tyler has made appearances in film and television and served as a judge on the popular show American
      Idol, where he introduced his larger-than-life personality to a new generation of fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to his contributions to music, Tyler is an advocate for various charitable causes. He founded Janie’s
      Fund, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting abused and neglected girls. Through his philanthropy and
      personal story of overcoming addiction, he has inspired countless people around the world to find strength and
      resilience in the face of adversity.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>Q&A</h2>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>1. The three main differences between Web1, Web2, and Web3</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Web1 was primarily read-only with static content where users were
            passive consumers of information. Web2 introduced interactive elements allowing users to both consume and
            create content (user-generated content). Web3 takes this further by enabling users to not only interact with
            content but also own digital assets and participate in decentralized governance.</li>
          <li><strong>Architecture and Control:</strong> Web1 had centralized architectures with clear distinctions
            between content providers and users. Web2 maintained centralization but with platforms facilitating user
            interactions while collecting and controlling user data (Facebook, Google, etc.). Web3 introduces
            decentralized architectures based on blockchain technology, where control is distributed among users rather
            than concentrated in corporate entities.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Ownership and Value Exchange:</strong> In Web1, data flowed one-way from website to user with
            limited monetization. In Web2, user data became the product, with companies monetizing personal information
            through advertising. Web3 shifts toward user ownership of data, allowing individuals to control their
            information and potentially receive compensation for its use through tokenization and smart contracts.</li>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>2. The differance of the Music Fan Experience between web1, web2 and web3</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <h4>Web1:</h4>
        <p>In Web1, a fan of Steven Tyler or Aerosmith would experience a static, one-way relationship with the artist.
          Official band websites would contain basic information like tour dates, album releases, and artist biographies
          written by the record label. Fans could read content but couldn't interact with it or other fans. Music was
          purchased physically or downloaded from specific platforms with rigid pricing models. The experience was
          controlled entirely by the artist, management, and record companies.</p>

        <h4>Web2:</h4>
        <p>Web2 transformed the fan experience into a social one. Fans follow Steven Tyler on platforms like Instagram,
          YouTube, and Twitter, where they can comment, share, and interact with content. Fan communities emerge on
          social media and forums to discuss music, share concert experiences, and create fan art. Streaming services
          like Spotify allow music consumption through subscription models, while platforms collect data on listening
          habits to recommend similar artists. Though more interactive, the economic value and data generated still
          primarily benefit the platforms and record labels rather than fans or sometimes even artists.</p>

        <h4>Web3:</h4>
        <p>In Web3, the relationship between Steven Tyler and fans becomes direct and mutually valuable. Fans might
          purchase digital collectibles (NFTs) that grant exclusive content access, virtual meet-and-greets, or even
          shares in royalties from specific songs. Artists can release music directly to fans through decentralized
          platforms where they set their own terms without middlemen taking large cuts. Fan communities evolve into DAOs
          (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) that might fund new album projects, vote on tour locations, or
          collaborate on creative decisions. Superfans could earn tokens for promoting concerts or creating viral
          content that increases the artist's popularity. The value exchange becomes multi-directional, with both
          artists and engaged fans benefiting from their mutual relationship without corporate platforms controlling the
          interaction.</p>
