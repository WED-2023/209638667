    Steven Tyler is an iconic American singer, songwriter, and performer, best known as the dynamic frontman of the legendary rock band Aerosmith. Born on March 26, 1948, in Yonkers, New York, Tyler’s journey into music began at an early age, influenced by his father, who was a classical musician. His powerful vocals, wide vocal range, and unmistakable scream quickly set him apart, earning him the nickname "The Demon of Screamin’" and establishing him as one of the most recognizable voices in rock and roll history.
